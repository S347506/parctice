                Product Backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done maintained by the product owner or
                product manager. This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as
                the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, the team's 'To Do ' list. The product backlog is
                constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or as
                the market changes, items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprint Backlog is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for
                implementation in the current sprint cycle. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting (which
                we'll discuss later in the article) the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the
                product backlog. A sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint. However, the
                fundamental sprint goal '96 what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint '96 cannot be
                compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
                Increment (or Sprint Goal) is the usable end-product from a sprint. At Atlassian, we usually demonstrate
                the 'increment ' during the end-of-sprint demo, where the team shows what was completed in the sprint.
                You may not hear the word 'increment ' out in the world, as it's often referred to as the team's
                definition of 'Done ', a milestone, the sprint goal, or even a full version or a shipped epic. It just
                depends on how your teams defines 'Done ' and how you define your sprint goals. For example, some teams
                choose to release something to their customers at the end of every sprint. So their definition of 'done'
                would be 'shipped'. However, this may not be realistic of other types of teams. Say you work on a
                server-based product that can only ship to your customers every quarter. You may still choose to work in
                2-week sprints, but your definition of 'done' may be finishing part of a larger version that you plan to
                ship together. But of course, the longer it takes to release software, the higher the risk that software
                will miss the mark.

                As you can tell, there are lots of variations, even within artifacts, that your team can choose to
                define. That's why it's important to be remain open to evolving how you maintain even your artifacts.
                Perhaps your definition of 'done' provides undo stress on your team, and you need to go back and pick a
                new definition.
                Pro tip
            </p>

                You should be just as agile with your framework as you are with your product. Take the necessary time to
                check in on how things are going, make adjustments if needed, and don' force something just for the sake
                of consistency.

                Scrum ceremonies or events

                Some of the more well-known components of the scrum framework are the set of sequential events,
                ceremonies, or meetings that scrum teams perform on a regular basis. The ceremonies are where we see the
                most variations for teams. For example, some teams find doing all of these ceremonies cumbersome and
                repetitive, while others use them as a necessary check-in. Our advice is to start out using all of the
                ceremonies for two sprints and see how it feels. You can then perform a quick retro and see where you
                might need to adjust.
