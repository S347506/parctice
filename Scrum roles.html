                Below is a list of all the key ceremonies a scrum team might partake in:
                Organize the backlog: Sometimes known as backlog grooming, this event is the responsibility of the
                product owner. The product owner's main jobs are to drive the product towards its product vision and
                have a constant pulse on the market and the customer. Therefore, he/she maintains this list using
                feedback from users and the development team to help prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to be
                worked on at any given time. You can read more about maintaining a healthy backlog here. uc0
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprint planning: The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this
                meeting by the entire development team. This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team
                decides on the sprint goal. Specific use stories are then added to the sprint from the product backlog.
                These stories always align with the goal and are also agreed upon by the scrum team to be feasible to
                implement during the sprint. At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on
                what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprint: A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment.
                Two weeks is a pretty typical length for a sprint, though some teams find a week to be easier to scope
                or a month to be easier to deliver a valuable increment. Dave West, from Scrum.org advises that the more
                complex the work and the more unknowns, the shorter the sprint should be. But it's really up to your
                team, and you shouldn' be afraid to change it if it's not working! During this period, the scope can be
                re-negotiated between the product owner and the development team if necessary. This forms the crux of
                the empirical nature of scrum. All the events '97 from planning to retrospective '97 happen during the
                sprint. Once a certain time interval for a sprint is established, it has to remain consistent throughout
                the development period. This helps the team learn from past experiences and apply that insight to future
                sprints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Daily scrum or stand up: This is a daily super-short meeting that happens at the same time (usually
                mornings) and place to keep it simple. Many teams try to complete the meeting in 15 minutes, but that's
                just a guideline. This meeting is also called a 'daily stand-up' emphasizing that it needs to be a quick
                one. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the
                sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours. The stand up is the time to voice any concerns
                you have with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers. A common way to conduct a stand up is for every
                team member to answers three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal? What did I do
                yesterday? What do I plan to do today?Are there any obstacles? However, we've seen the meeting quickly
                turn into people reading from their calendars from yesterday and for the next day. The theory behind the
                stand up is that it keep distracting chatter to a daily meeting, so the team can focus on the work for
                the rest of the day. So if it turns into a daily calendar read-out, don' be afraid to change it up and
                get creative.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            Sprint review: At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of,
            or inspect, the increment. The development team showcases the backlog items that are now 'Done' to
            stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not to release the
            increment, although in most cases the increment is released. This review meeting is also when the product
            owner reworks the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can feed into the next sprint planning
            session. For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprint retrospective: The retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what
                worked and what didn' work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain
                ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to
                be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong.
            </p>

                cf2 Three essential roles for scrum success
                A scrum team needs three specific roles: product owner, scrum master, and the development team. And
                because scrum teams are cross-functional, the development team includes testers, designers, UX
                specialists, and ops engineers in addition to developers.

                The scrum product owner
                Product owners are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business,
                customer, and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team
                accordingly. Effective product owners:

                Build and manage the product backlog.

                Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the
                product backlog.

                Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.

                Decide when to ship the product with a predisposition towards more frequent delivery.

                The product owner is not always the product manager. Product owners focus on ensuring the development
                team delivers the most value to the business. Also, it's important that the product owner be an
                individual. No development team wants mixed guidance from multiple product owners.
